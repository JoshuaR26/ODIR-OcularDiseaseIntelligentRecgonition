# <u>ODIR-Ocular Disease Intelligent Recgonition</u>

Leveraging the power of Deep Learning, our project aims to help assist medical professionsals and institutions in the field of ophthalmology, detect ocular diseases with high precission and accuracy.

Although I and my team are novices in this vast field of Deep Learning, we were successfull in developing an efficient CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model that yields high accuracy and promising results.
