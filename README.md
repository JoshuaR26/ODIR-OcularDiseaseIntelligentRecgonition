# <u>Ocular Disease Intelligent Recgonition (ODIR)</u>


Harnessing the power of Deep Learning, our project is dedicated to assist medical professionsals and institutions in the field of ophthalmology, detect ocular diseases with reamrkable precision and accuracy.

Although I and my team are newcomers to this vast field of Deep Learning, we take pride in our achievement of developing an effective CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model that yields high accuracy and promising results.

In the repository, you will find various different versions of `.ipynb` notebooks. The one in interest would be `ODIR_v3(cataract).ipynb`. As the name suggests, this model is trained to predict cataract. Cataract being one of most common vision impairment, affecting millions of lives around the world. If the condition is left untreated, the victim may suffer severe vison loss.

One of the major challenges we faced was the insufficiency of image data for training. However, we overcame the challenge by implementing *Data Augmentation* , which itself is a intriguing concept and we look forward to delve deeper into in the near future.

Now of course, the project plan is not to stop at cataract. Our final goal is exapnding our model's capabillities to predict other ocular diseases as well. We are currently enhancing our knowledge by exposing ourselves to more methodolgies that can tackle this challenge more efficiently with greater precision.

Our heartfelt gratitude goes to our faculty, Mr. Karthikeyan N, who pushed us out of our comfort zone to venture into this field, and guided us every step on our journey.

**DISCLAIMER:** 
While our CNN model aids in cataract detection, it is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Please consult a qualified healthcare provider for a comprehensive eye examination and diagnosis.
